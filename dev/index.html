<p>
I have come here to-night, partly because I want to hear Mr. Russell, and partly because of an old affection for South Place and its traditions. I myself have been for more than forty years a professional teacher; and it is as a teacher—who thirty-seven years ago was dismissed for refusing religious conformity—that I most easily approach the problem of free thought. Though systems of education professing to teach men and women how to think have been in use in Europe for, perhaps, three thousand years, we have not yet reached that degree of success which would be shown if most educated people came to much the same conclusions on the great problems of life from a study of the same evidence. Everywhere you have rebels; but ninety per cent. of French or American students of history come to French or American conclusions, and eighty-five per cent. of English students come to English conclusions; eighty per cent. of Eton boys hold Eton political opinions all their lives; ninety per cent. of the Irish Catholic population of the United States seem to hold generation after generation identical opinions on religion and politics which are not held by the vast majority of Americans.
</p>
<p>It may be said that in these cases only one kind of evidence is allowed to reach the students in each institution. But everybody reads newspapers, and talks with his neighbours, and travels, and visits museums; and most intelligent people read books and magazines. Sooner or later much of the same evidence reaches us all. I myself believe that one of the main reasons why we do not to a greater degree draw the same conclusions from that evidence is that we do not really learn the difficult art of thought. A boy at school is taught to memorize and to understand mathematical formulæ or foreign languages or scientific statements. But in weighing evidence the effort of memorizing, and even the effort of understanding, are not of the first importance. The effective process is a sort of painful and watchful expectancy. A schoolboy or a college student finds that he has an uncomfortable sense of unreality in repeating some accustomed formula, or writing an essay to enforce some accustomed line of argument. He shrinks from that feeling, as all animals shrink from discomfort. If he were taught what are the conditions of effective thought, and were encouraged to act on that lesson, he would know that it is only by resolutely fastening on such vague and painful premonitions, and forcing them to come into full consciousness and disclose their deeper causes and tendencies that he can arrive at new truth or make some old truth his own.
</p>

<p>
But who is going to tell him this secret? Every day in London thousands of clever and sympathetic boys and girls begin the day by sitting through three-quarters of an hour of the dreary “Cowper-Temple” instruction which consists, as Bishop Temple once said, of teaching at everybody’s expense what nobody believes. They may be conscious or half-conscious of a feeling of unreality; but, even if they have not been taught that it is a sacred duty to “struggle against doubt,” they shrink, as the cleverest of them feel that the teacher is shrinking, from any further exploration on that path.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps some day the teachers and students of the ordinary school and college subjects may learn something from those little isolated institutions where men and women try to prepare themselves for the creative arts. The young painter or sculptor or member of a group of young poets is often queerly ignorant and one-sided. But he lives in another world from that of the big conventional sixth-form boy at Harrow or St. Paul’s, or the hockey-playing athlete of a girls’ High School, because he has felt the pain and the exhilaration reached through pain by which alone new truth and new beauty are born into the world.

  <h2>FREE THOUGHT AND OFFICIAL PROPAGANDA</h2>

<figure class="fadein fig offset offset--right">
  <img src="assets/img/moncure_conway.jpg" alt="Professor Graham Wallas, Chairman">

<p><span
class=SpellE>Moncure Conway</span>, in whose <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
we are assembled to-day, devoted his life to two great objects: freedom of
thought and freedom of the individual. In regard to both these objects,
something has been gained since his time, but something also has been lost. New
dangers, somewhat different in form from those of past ages, threaten both
kinds of freedom, and unless a vigorous and vigilant public opinion can be
aroused in <span class=SpellE>defence</span> of them, there will be much less
of both a hundred years hence than there is now. My purpose in this address is
to emphasize the new dangers and to consider how they can be met.</p>

<p>Let us begin by trying to be clear as
to what we mean by “free thought.” This expression has two senses. In its
narrower sense it means thought which does not accept
the dogmas of traditional religion. In this sense a man is a “free thinker” if
he is not a Christian or a Mussulman or a Buddhist or a <span class=SpellE>Shintoist</span>
or a member of any of the other bodies of men who accept some inherited
orthodoxy. In Christian countries a man is called a “free thinker” if he does
not decidedly believe in God, though this would not suffice to make a man a
“free thinker” in a Buddhist country.</p>

<p>I do not wish to minimize the
importance of free thought in this sense. I am myself a dissenter from all
known religions, and I hope that every kind of religious belief will die out. I
do not believe that, on the balance, religious belief has been a force for
good. Although I am prepared to admit that in certain times and places it has
had some good effects, I regard it as belonging to the infancy of human reason,
and to a stage of development which we are now outgrowing.</p>

<p>But there is also a wider sense of
“free thought,” which I regard as of still greater importance. Indeed, the harm
done by traditional religions seems chiefly traceable to the fact that they
have prevented free thought in this wider sense. The
wider sense is not so easy to define as the narrower, and it will be well to
spend some little time in trying to arrive at its essence.</p>

<p>When we speak of anything as “free,”
our meaning is not definite unless we can say what it is free <i>from</i>.
Whatever or whoever is “free” is not subject to some external compulsion, and
to be precise we ought to say what this kind of compulsion is. Thus thought is
“free” when it is free from certain kinds of outward control which are often
present. Some of these kinds of control which must be absent if thought is to
be “free” are obvious, but others are more subtle and elusive.</p>

<p>To begin with the most obvious. Thought
is not “free” when legal penalties are incurred by the holding or not holding
of certain opinions, or by giving expression to one’s belief or lack of belief
on certain matters. Very few countries in the world have as yet even this
elementary kind of freedom. In England, under the Blasphemy Laws, it is illegal
to express disbelief in the Christian religion, though in practice the law is
not set in motion against the well-to-do. It is also
illegal to teach what Christ taught on the subject of non-resistance.
Therefore, whoever wishes to avoid becoming a criminal must profess to agree
with Christ’s teaching, but must avoid saying what that teaching <span
class=GramE>was.</span> In America no one can enter the country without first
solemnly declaring that he disbelieves in anarchism and polygamy; and, once
inside, he must also disbelieve in communism. In Japan it is illegal to express
disbelief in the divinity of the Mikado. It will thus be seen that a voyage
round the world is a perilous adventure. A Mohammedan, a <span class=SpellE>Tolstoyan</span>,
a Bolshevik, or a Christian cannot undertake it without at some point becoming
a criminal, or holding his tongue about what he considers important truths.
This, of course, applies only to steerage passengers; saloon passengers are
allowed to believe whatever they please, provided they avoid offensive
obtrusiveness.</p>

<p>It is clear that the most elementary
condition, if thought is to be free, is the absence of legal penalties for the
expression of opinions. No great country has yet reached
to this level, although most of them think they have. The opinions which are
still persecuted strike the majority as so monstrous and immoral that the
general principle of toleration cannot be held to apply to them. But this is
exactly the same view as that which made possible the tortures of the
Inquisition. There was a time when Protestantism seemed as wicked as Bolshevism
seems now. Please do not infer from this remark that I am either a Protestant
or a Bolshevik.</p>

<p>Legal penalties are, however, in the
modern world, the least of the obstacles to freedom of thoughts. The two great
obstacles are economic penalties and distortion of evidence. It is clear that
thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions makes it impossible
to earn a living. It is clear also that thought is not free if all the
arguments on one side of a controversy are perpetually presented as
attractively as possible, while the arguments on the other side can only be
discovered by diligent search. Both these obstacles exist in every large
country known to me, except China, which is the last refuge of freedom. It is these obstacles with which I shall be concerned—their
present magnitude, the likelihood of their increase, and the possibility of
their diminution.</p>

<p>We may say that thought is free when it
is exposed to free competition among beliefs—i.e., when all beliefs are able to
state their case, and no legal or pecuniary advantages or disadvantages attach
to beliefs. This is an ideal which, for various reasons, can never be fully
attained. But it is possible to approach very much nearer to it than we do at
present.</p>

<p>Three incidents in my own life will
serve to show how, in modern England, the scales are weighted in <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> of Christianity. My reason for mentioning them is
that many people do not at all realize the disadvantages to which avowed
Agnosticism still exposes people.</p>

<p>The first incident belongs to a very
early stage in my life. My father was a Freethinker, but died when I was only
three years old. Wishing me to be brought up without superstition, he appointed
two Freethinkers as my guardians. The Courts, however, set aside his will, and had me educated in the Christian faith. I
am afraid the result was disappointing, but that was not the fault of the law. If
he had directed that I should be educated as a Christadelphian or a <span
class=SpellE>Muggletonian</span> or a <span class=GramE>Seventh-Day</span>
Adventist, the Courts would not have dreamed of objecting. A parent has a right
to ordain that any imaginable superstition shall be instilled into his children
after his death, but has not the right to say that they shall be kept free from
superstition if possible.</p>

<p>The second incident occurred in the
year 1910. I had at that time a desire to stand for Parliament as a Liberal,
and the Whips recommended me to a certain constituency. I addressed the Liberal
Association, who expressed themselves <span class=SpellE>favourably</span>, and
my adoption seemed certain. But, on being questioned by a small inner caucus, I
admitted that I was an Agnostic. They asked whether the fact would come out,
and I said it probably would. They asked whether I should be willing to go to
church occasionally, and I replied that I should not. Consequently, they
selected another candidate, who was duly elected, has
been in Parliament ever since, and is a member of the present Government.</p>

<p>The third incident occurred immediately
afterwards. I was invited by Trinity College, Cambridge, to become a lecturer,
but not a Fellow. The difference is not pecuniary; it is that a Fellow has a
voice in the government of the College, and cannot be dispossessed during the
term of his Fellowship except for grave immorality. The chief reason for not
offering me a Fellowship was that the clerical party did not wish to add to the
anti-clerical vote. The result was that they were able to dismiss me in 1916,
when they disliked my views on the War.<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" 
href="#dismissed" id="dismissed-ref"></a>
If I had been dependent on my lectureship, I should have starved.</p>

<p>These three incidents illustrate
different kinds of disadvantages attaching to avowed freethinking even in
modern England. Any other avowed Freethinker could supply similar incidents
from his personal experience, often of a far more serious character. The net
result is that people who are not well-to-do dare not be frank about their
religious beliefs.</p>

<p>It is not, of course, only or even
chiefly in regard to religion that there is lack of freedom. Belief in
communism or free love handicaps a man much more than Agnosticism. Not only is
it a disadvantage to hold those views, but it is very much more difficult to
obtain publicity for the arguments in their <span class=SpellE>favour</span>.
On the other hand, in Russia the advantages and disadvantages are exactly
reversed: comfort and power are achieved by professing Atheism, communism, and
free love, and no opportunity exists for propaganda against these opinions. The
result is that in Russia one set of fanatics feels absolute certainty about one
set of doubtful propositions, while in the rest of the world another set of fanatics
feels equal certainty about a diametrically opposite set of equally doubtful
propositions. From such a situation war, bitterness, and persecution inevitably
result on both sides.</p>

<p>William James used to preach the “will
to believe.” For my part, I should wish to preach the “will to doubt.” None of
our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and
error. The methods of increasing the degree of truth
in our beliefs are well known; they consist in hearing all sides, trying to
ascertain all the relevant facts, controlling our own bias by discussion with
people who have the opposite bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard any
hypothesis which has proved inadequate. These methods are <span class=SpellE>practised</span>
in science, and have built up the body of scientific knowledge. Every man of
science whose outlook is truly scientific is ready to admit that what passes
for scientific knowledge at the moment is sure to require correction with the
progress of discovery; nevertheless, it is near enough to the truth to serve
for most practical purposes, though not for all. In science, where alone
something approximating to genuine knowledge is to be found, men’s attitude is
tentative and full of doubt.</p>

<p>In religion and politics, on the
contrary, though there is as yet nothing approaching scientific knowledge,
everybody considers it <i>de rigueur</i> to have a dogmatic opinion, to be
backed up by inflicting starvation, prison, and war, and to be carefully
guarded from argumentative competition with any different opinion. If only men
could be brought into a tentatively agnostic frame of
mind about these matters, nine-tenths of the evils of the modern world would be
cured. War would become impossible, because each side would realize that both
sides must be in the wrong. Persecution would cease. Education would aim at
expanding the mind, not at narrowing it. Men would be chosen for jobs on
account of fitness to do the work, not because they flattered the irrational
dogmas of those in power. Thus rational doubt alone, if it could be generated,
would suffice to introduce the millennium.</p>

<p>We have had in recent years a brilliant
example of the scientific temper of mind in the theory of relativity and its
reception by the world. Einstein, a German-Swiss-Jew pacifist, was appointed to
a research professorship by the German Government in the early days of the War;
his predictions were verified by an English expedition which observed the
eclipse of 1919, very soon after the Armistice. His theory upsets the whole
theoretical framework of traditional physics; it is almost as damaging to
orthodox dynamics as Darwin was to <i>Genesis</i>. Yet physicists everywhere have shown complete readiness to accept his
theory as soon as it appeared that the evidence was in its <span class=SpellE>favour</span>.
But none of them, least of all Einstein himself, would claim that he has said
the last word. He has not built a monument of infallible dogma to stand for all
time. There are difficulties he cannot solve; his doctrines will have to be
modified in their turn as they have modified Newton’s. This critical undogmatic
receptiveness is the true attitude of science.</p>

<p>What would have happened if Einstein
had advanced something equally new in the sphere of religion or politics?
English people would have found elements of <span class=SpellE>Prussianism</span>
in his theory; anti-Semites would have regarded it as a Zionist plot;
nationalists in all countries would have found it tainted with lily-livered
pacifism, and proclaimed it a mere dodge for escaping military service. All the
old-fashioned professors would have approached Scotland Yard to get the
importation of his writings prohibited. Teachers <span class=SpellE>favourable</span>
to him would have been dismissed. He, meantime, would have captured the
Government of some backward country, where it would have
become illegal to teach anything except his doctrine, which would have grown
into a mysterious dogma not understood by anybody. Ultimately the truth or
falsehood of his doctrine would be decided on the battlefield, without the
collection of any fresh evidence for or against it. This method is the logical
outcome of William James’s will to believe.</p>

<p>What is wanted is not the will to
believe, but the wish to find out, which is its exact opposite.</p>

<p>If it is admitted that a condition of
rational doubt would be desirable, it becomes important to inquire how it comes
about that there is so much irrational certainty in the world. A great deal of
this is due to the inherent irrationality and credulity of average human
nature. But this seed of intellectual original sin is nourished and fostered by
other agencies, among which three play the chief part—namely, education,
propaganda, and economic pressure. Let us consider these in turn.</p>

  <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
  
<p>(1) <i>Education.</i>—Elementary
education, in all advanced countries, is in the hands of the State. Some of the
things taught are known to be false by the officials
who prescribe them, and many others are known to be false, or at any rate very
doubtful, by every unprejudiced person. Take, for example, the teaching of
history. Each nation aims only at self-glorification in the school text-books
of history. When a man writes his autobiography he is expected to show a
certain modesty; but when a nation writes its autobiography there is no limit
to its boasting and vainglory. When I was young, school books taught that the French
were wicked and the Germans virtuous; now they teach the opposite. In neither
case is there the slightest regard for truth.</p>

<p>German school books, dealing with
the battle of Waterloo, represent Wellington as all but defeated when <span
class=SpellE>Blücher</span> saved the situation; English books represent <span
class=SpellE>Blücher</span> as having made very little difference. The writers
of both the German and the English books know that they are not telling the
truth. American school books used to be violently anti-British; since the War
they have become equally pro-British, without aiming at truth in either case
(see <i>The Freeman</i>, Feb. 15, 1922, p. 532). Both before
and since, one of the chief purposes of education in the United States has been
to turn the motley collection of immigrant children into “good Americans.”
Apparently it has not occurred to any one that a “good American,” like a “good
German” or a “good Japanese,” must be, <i>pro <span class=SpellE>tanto</span></i>,
a bad human being. A “good American” is a man or woman imbued with the belief
that America is the finest country on earth, and ought always to be
enthusiastically supported in any quarrel. It is just possible that these
propositions are true; if so, a rational man will have no quarrel with them.
But if they are true, they ought to be taught everywhere, not only in America.
It is a suspicious circumstance that such propositions are never believed
outside the particular country which they glorify. Meanwhile the whole
machinery of the State, in all the different countries, is turned on to making <span
class=SpellE>defenceless</span> children believe absurd propositions the effect
of which is to make them willing to die in <span class=SpellE>defence</span> of
sinister interests under the impression that they are fighting for truth and
right. This is only one of countless ways in which education
is designed, not to give true knowledge, but to make the people pliable to the
will of their masters. Without an elaborate system of deceit in the elementary
schools it would be impossible to preserve the camouflage of democracy.</p>

<p><a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#america" id="america-ref">Before leaving the subject of education, I will take another example from America</a>—not
because America is any worse than other countries, but because it is the most
modern, showing the dangers that are growing rather than those that are
diminishing. In the State of New York a school cannot be established without a <span
class=SpellE>licence</span> from the State, even if it is to be supported
wholly by private funds. A recent law decrees that a <span class=SpellE>licence</span>
shall not be granted to any school “where it shall appear that the instruction
proposed to be given includes the teachings of the doctrine that organized
Governments shall be overthrown by force, violence, or unlawful means.” As the <i>New
Republic</i> points out, there is no limitation to this or that organized
Government. The law therefore would have made it
illegal, during the War, to teach the doctrine that the Kaiser’s Government
should be overthrown by force; and, since then, the support of Kolchak or <span
class=SpellE>Denikin</span> against the Soviet Government would have been
illegal. Such consequences, of course, were not intended, and result only from
bad <span class=SpellE>draughtsmanship</span>. What was intended appears from
another law passed at the same time, applying to teachers in State schools.
This law provides that certificates permitting persons to teach in such schools
shall be issued only to those who have “shown satisfactorily” that they are
“loyal and obedient to the Government of this State and of the United States,”
and shall be refused to those who have advocated, no matter where or when, “a
form of government other than the Government of this State or of the United
States.” The committee which framed these laws, as quoted by the <i>New
Republic</i>, laid it down that the teacher who “does not approve of the
present social system......must surrender his office,” and that “no person who
is not eager to combat the theories of social change should be entrusted with
the task of fitting the young and old for the
responsibilities of citizenship.” Thus, according to the law of the State of
New York, Christ and George Washington were too degraded morally to be fit for
the education of the young. If Christ were to go to New York and say, “Suffer
the little children to come unto me,” the President of the New York School
Board would reply: “Sir, I see no evidence that you are eager to combat
theories of social change. Indeed, I have heard it said that you advocate what
you call the <i>kingdom</i> of heaven, whereas this country, thank God, is a
republic. It is clear that the Government of your kingdom of heaven would
differ materially from that of New York State, therefore no children will be
allowed access to you.” If he failed to make this reply, he would not be doing
his duty as a functionary entrusted with the administration of the law.</p>

<p>The effect of such laws is very
serious. Let it be granted, for the sake of argument, that the government and
the social system in the State of New York are the best that have ever existed
on this planet; yet even then both would presumably be capable of improvement. Any person who admits this obvious
proposition is by law incapable of teaching in a State school. Thus the law
decrees that the teachers shall all be either hypocrites or fools.</p>

<p>The growing danger exemplified by the
New York law is that resulting from the monopoly of power in the hands of a
single organization, whether the State or a Trust or federation of Trusts. In
the case of education, the power is in the hands of the State, which can
prevent the young from hearing of any doctrine which it dislikes. I believe
there are still some people who think that a democratic State is scarcely
distinguishable from the people. This, however, is a delusion. The State is a
collection of officials, different for different purposes, drawing comfortable
incomes so long as the <i>status quo</i> is preserved. The only alteration they
are likely to desire in the <i>status quo</i> is an increase of bureaucracy and
of the power of bureaucrats. It is, therefore, natural that they should take
advantage of such opportunities as war excitement to acquire inquisitorial
powers over their employees, involving the right to inflict starvation upon any
subordinate who opposes them. In matters of the mind,
such as education, this state of affairs is fatal. It puts an end to all
possibility of progress or freedom or intellectual initiative. Yet it is the
natural result of allowing the whole of elementary education to fall under the
sway of a single organization.</p>

<p>Religious toleration, to a certain
extent, has been won because people have ceased to consider religion <span
class=GramE>so</span> important as it was once thought to be. But in politics
and economics, which have taken the place formerly occupied by religion, there
is a growing tendency to persecution, which is not by any means confined to one
party. The persecution of opinion in Russia is more severe than in any
capitalist country. I met in Petrograd an eminent Russian poet, Alexander
Block, who has since died as the result of privations. The Bolsheviks allowed
him to teach <span class=SpellE>æsthetics</span>, but he complained that they
insisted on his teaching the subject “from a Marxian point of view.” He had
been at a loss to discover how the theory of <span class=SpellE>rhythmics</span>
was connected with Marxism, although, to avoid starvation, he had done his best
to find out. Of course, it has been impossible in Russia ever since the Bolsheviks came into power to print anything critical
of the dogmas upon which their regime is founded.</p>

<p>The examples of America and Russia
illustrate the conclusion to which we seem to be driven—namely, that so long as
men continue to have the present fanatical belief in the importance of politics
free thought on political matters will be impossible, and there is only too
much danger that the lack of freedom will spread to all other matters, as it
has done in Russia. Only some degree of political <span class=SpellE>scepticism</span>
can save us from this misfortune.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the
officials in charge of education desire the young to become educated. On the
contrary, their problem is to impart information without imparting
intelligence. Education should have two objects: first, to give definite
knowledge—reading and writing, languages and mathematics, and so on; secondly,
to create those mental habits which will enable people to acquire knowledge and
form sound judgments for themselves. The first of these we may call
information, the second intelligence. The utility of information is admitted
practically as well as theoretically; without a
literate population a modern State is impossible. But the utility of
intelligence is admitted only theoretically, not practically; it is not desired
that ordinary people should think for themselves, because it is felt that
people who think for themselves are awkward to manage and cause administrative
difficulties. Only the guardians, in Plato’s language, are to think; the rest
are to obey, or to follow leaders like a herd of sheep. This doctrine, often
unconsciously, has survived the introduction of political democracy, and has
radically vitiated all national systems of education.</p>

<p>The country which has succeeded best in giving information without intelligence is the latest addition to modern civilization, Japan. Elementary education in Japan is said to be admirable from the point of view of instruction. <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#mikado" id="mikado-ref">But, in addition to instruction, it has another purpose, which is to teach worship of the Mikado—a far stronger creed now than before Japan became modernized.</a>
Thus the schools have been used simultaneously to
confer knowledge and to promote superstition. Since we are not tempted to
Mikado-worship, we see clearly what is absurd in Japanese teaching. Our own
national superstitions strike us as natural and sensible, so that we do not
take such a true view of them as we do of the superstitions of Nippon. But if a
travelled Japanese were to maintain the thesis that our schools teach
superstitions just as inimical to intelligence as belief in the divinity of the
Mikado, I suspect that he would be able to make out a very good case.</p>

<p>For the present I am not in search of
remedies, but am only concerned with diagnosis. We are faced with the
paradoxical fact that education has become one of the chief obstacles to
intelligence and freedom of thought. This is due primarily to the fact that the
State claims a monopoly; but that is by no means the sole cause.</p>

<section class="section js-section" id="propaganda">
  <h2>PROPAGANDA</h2>
  
<p>(2) <i>Propaganda.</i>—<span
class=GramE>Our</span> system of education turns young people out of the
schools able to read, but for the most part unable to weigh evidence or to form
an independent opinion. They are then assailed, throughout the rest of their lives, by statements designed to make them
believe all sorts of absurd propositions, such as that Blank’s pills cure all
ills, that Spitzbergen is warm and fertile, and that Germans eat corpses. The
art of propaganda, as <span class=SpellE>practised</span> by modern politicians
and governments, is derived from the art of advertisement. The science of
psychology owes a great deal to advertisers. In former days most psychologists
would probably have thought that a man could not convince many people of the
excellence of his own wares by merely stating emphatically that they were
excellent. Experience shows, however, that they were mistaken in this. If I
were to stand up once in a public place and state that I am the most modest man
alive, I should be laughed at; but if I could raise enough money to make the
same statement on all the busses and on hoardings along all the principal
railway lines, people would presently become convinced that I had an abnormal
shrinking from publicity. If I were to go to a small shopkeeper and say: “Look
at your competitor over the way, he is getting your business; don’t you think
it would be a good plan to leave your business and
stand up in the middle of the road and try to shoot him before he shoots
you?”—if I were to say this, any small shopkeeper would think me mad. But when
the Government says it with emphasis and a brass band, the small shopkeepers
become enthusiastic, and are quite surprised when they find afterwards that
business has suffered. Propaganda, conducted by the means which advertisers
have found successful, is now one of the recognized methods of government in
all advanced countries, and is especially the method by which democratic
opinion is created.</p>

<p>There are two quite different evils
about propaganda as now <span class=SpellE>practised</span>. On the one hand,
its appeal is generally to irrational causes of belief rather than to serious
argument; on the other hand, it gives an unfair advantage to those who can
obtain most publicity, whether through wealth or through power. For my part, I
am inclined to think that too much fuss is sometimes made about the fact that
propaganda appeals to emotion rather than reason. The line between emotion and
reason is not <span class=GramE>so</span> sharp as some people
think. Moreover, a clever man could frame a sufficiently rational argument in <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> of any position which has any chance of being
adopted. There are always good arguments on both sides of any real issue.
Definite <span class=SpellE>mis</span>-statements of fact can be legitimately
objected to, but they are by no means necessary. The mere words “Pear’s Soap,”
which affirm nothing, cause people to buy that article. If, wherever these
words appear, they were replaced by the words “The <span class=SpellE>Labour</span>
Party,” millions of people would be led to vote for the <span class=SpellE>Labour</span>
Party, although the advertisements had claimed no merit for it whatever. But if
both sides in a controversy were confined by law to statements which a
committee of eminent logicians considered relevant and valid, the main evil of
propaganda, as at present conducted, would remain. Suppose, under such a law,
two parties with an equally good case, one of whom had a million pounds to
spend on propaganda, while the other had only a hundred thousand. It is obvious
that the arguments in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of the richer party
would become more widely known than those in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
of the poorer party, and therefore the richer party
would win. This situation is, of course, intensified when one party is the
Government. In Russia the Government has an almost complete monopoly of
propaganda, but that is not necessary. The advantages which it possesses over
its opponents will generally be sufficient to give it the victory, unless it
has an exceptionally bad case.</p>

<p>The objection to propaganda is not only
its appeal to unreason, but still more the unfair advantage which it gives to
the rich and powerful. Equality of opportunity among opinions is essential if
there is to be real freedom of thought; and equality of opportunity among
opinions can only be secured by elaborate laws directed to that end, which
there is no reason to expect to see enacted. The cure is not to be sought
primarily in such laws, but in better education and a more <span class=SpellE>sceptical</span>
public opinion. For the moment, however, I am not concerned to discuss cures.</p>

<section class="section js-section" id="economic-pressure">
  <h2>ECONOMIC PRESSURE</h2>
  <p>(3) <i>Economic pressure.</i>—I have
already dealt with some aspects of this obstacle to freedom of thought, but I
wish now to deal with it on more general lines, as a danger which is bound to
increase unless very definite steps are taken to
counteract it. The supreme example of economic pressure applied against freedom
of thought is Soviet Russia, where, until the trade agreement, the Government
could and did inflict starvation upon people whose opinions it disliked—for
example, Kropotkin. But in this respect Russia is only somewhat ahead of other
countries. In France, during the Dreyfus affair, any teacher would have lost
his position if he had been in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of Dreyfus at
the start or against him at the end. In America at the present day I doubt if a
university professor, however eminent, could get employment if he were to
criticize the Standard Oil Company, because all college presidents have
received or hope to receive benefactions from Mr. Rockefeller. Throughout
America Socialists are marked men, and find it extremely difficult to obtain
work unless they have great gifts. The tendency, which exists wherever
industrialism is well developed, for trusts and monopolies to control all
industry, leads to a diminution of the number of possible employers, so that it
becomes easier and easier to keep secret black books by means of which any one
not subservient to the great corporations can be
starved. The growth of monopolies is introducing in America many of the evils
associated with State Socialism as it has existed in Russia. From the
standpoint of liberty, it makes no difference to a man whether his only
possible employer is the State or a Trust.</p>

<p>In America, which is the most advanced
country industrially, and to a lesser extent in other countries which are
approximating to the American condition, it is necessary for the average
citizen, if he wishes to make a living, to avoid incurring the hostility of
certain big men. And these big men have an outlook—religious, moral, and
political—with which they expect their employees to agree, at least outwardly.
A man who openly dissents from Christianity, or believes in a relaxation of the
marriage laws, or objects to the power of the great corporations, finds America
a very uncomfortable country, unless he happens to be an eminent writer.
Exactly the same kind of restraints upon freedom of thought are bound to occur
in every country where economic organization has been carried to the point of practical monopoly. Therefore the safeguarding
of liberty in the world which is growing up is far more difficult than it was
in the nineteenth century, when free competition was still a reality. Whoever
cares about the freedom of the mind must face this situation fully and frankly,
realizing the inapplicability of methods which answered well enough while
industrialism was in its infancy.</p>

<p>There are two simple principles which,
if they were adopted, would solve almost all social problems. The first is that
education should have for one of its aims to teach people only to believe
propositions when there is some reason to think that they are true. The second
is that jobs should be given solely for fitness to do the work.</p>

<p>To take the second point first. The
habit of considering a man’s religious, moral, and political opinions before
appointing him to a post or giving him a job is the modern form of persecution,
and it is likely to become quite as efficient as the Inquisition ever was. The
old liberties can be legally retained without being of the slightest use. If,
in practice, certain opinions lead a man to starve, it is
poor comfort to him to know that his opinions are not punishable by law. There
is a certain public feeling against starving men for not belonging to the
Church of England, or for holding slightly unorthodox opinions in politics. But
there is hardly any feeling against the rejection of Atheists or Mormons,
extreme communists, or men who advocate free love. Such men are thought to be
wicked, and it is considered only natural to refuse to employ them. People have
hardly yet waked up to the fact that this refusal, in a highly industrial
State, amounts to a very rigorous form of persecution.</p>

<p>If this danger were adequately
realized, it would be possible to rouse public opinion, and to secure that a
man’s beliefs should not be considered in appointing him to a post. The
protection of minorities is vitally important; and even the most orthodox of us
may find himself in a minority <span class=SpellE>some day</span>, so that we
all have an interest in restraining the tyranny of majorities. Nothing except
public opinion can solve this problem. Socialism would make it somewhat more
acute, since it would eliminate the opportunities that now
arise through exceptional employers. Every increase in the size of industrial
undertakings makes it worse, since it diminishes the number of independent
employers. The battle must be fought exactly as the battle of religious
toleration was fought. And as in that case, so in this, a decay in the
intensity of belief is likely to prove the decisive factor. While men were
convinced of the absolute truth of Catholicism or Protestantism, as the case
might be, they were willing to persecute on account of them. While men are
quite certain of their modern creeds, they will persecute on their behalf. Some
element of doubt is essential to the practice, though not to the theory, of
toleration. And this brings me to my other point, which concerns the aims of
education.</p>

<p>If there is to be toleration in the
world, one of the things taught in schools must be the habit of weighing
evidence, and the practice of not giving full assent to propositions which
there is no reason to believe true. For example, the art of reading the
newspapers should be taught. The schoolmaster should select some incident which
happened a good many years ago, and roused political passions in its day. He should then read to the school children what was said
by the newspapers on one side, what was said by those on the other, and some
impartial account of what really happened. He should show how, from the biased
account of either side, a <span class=SpellE>practised</span> reader could
infer what really happened, and he should make them understand that everything
in newspapers is more or less untrue. The cynical <span class=SpellE>scepticism</span>
which would result from this teaching would make the children in later life
immune from those appeals to idealism by which decent people are induced to
further the schemes of scoundrels.</p>

<p>History should be taught in the same
way. Napoleon’s campaigns of 1813 and 1814, for instance, might be studied in
the <span class=SpellE><i>Moniteur</i></span>, leading up to the surprise which
Parisians felt when they saw the Allies arriving under the walls of Paris after
they had (according to the official bulletins) been beaten by Napoleon in every
battle. In the more advanced classes, students should be encouraged to count
the number of times that Lenin has been assassinated by Trotsky, in order to
learn contempt for death. Finally, they should be given a
school history approved by the Government, and asked to infer what a French
school history would say about our wars with France. All this would be a far
better training in citizenship than the trite moral maxims by which some people
believe that civic duty can be inculcated.</p>

<p>It must, I think, be admitted that the
evils of the world are due to moral defects quite as much as to lack of
intelligence. But the human race has not hitherto discovered any method of
eradicating moral defects; preaching and exhortation only add hypocrisy to the
previous list of vices. Intelligence, on the contrary, is easily improved by
methods known to every competent educator. Therefore, until some method of
teaching virtue has been discovered, progress will have to be sought by
improvement of intelligence rather than of morals. One of the chief obstacles
to intelligence is credulity, and credulity could be enormously diminished by
instruction as to the prevalent forms of mendacity. Credulity is a greater evil
in the present day than it ever was before, because, owing to the growth of
education, it is much easier than it used to be to
spread misinformation, and, owing to democracy, the spread of misinformation is
more important than in former times to the holders of power. Hence the increase
in the circulation of newspapers.</p>

<p>If I am asked how the world is to be
induced to adopt these two maxims—namely (1) that jobs should be given to
people on account of their fitness to perform them; (2) that one aim of
education should be to cure people of the habit of believing propositions for
which there is no evidence—I can only say that it must be done by generating an
enlightened public opinion. And an enlightened public opinion can only be
generated by the efforts of those who desire that it should exist. I do not
believe that the economic changes advocated by Socialists will, of themselves,
do anything towards curing the evils we have been considering. I think that,
whatever happens in politics, the trend of economic development will make the
preservation of mental freedom increasingly difficult, unless public opinion
insists that the employer shall control nothing in the life of the employee
except his work. Freedom in education could easily be
secured, if it were desired, by limiting the function of the State to
inspection and payment, and confining inspection rigidly to the definite
instruction. But that, as things stand, would leave education in the hands of
the Churches, because, unfortunately, they are more anxious to teach their
beliefs than Freethinkers are to teach their doubts. It would, however, give a
free field, and would make it possible for a liberal education to be given if
it were really desired. More than that ought not to be asked of the law.</p>

<p>My plea throughout this address has
been for the spread of the scientific temper, which is an altogether different
thing from the knowledge of scientific results. The scientific temper is
capable of regenerating mankind and providing an issue for all our troubles.
The results of science, in the form of mechanism, poison gas, and the yellow
press, bid fair to lead to the total downfall of our civilization. It is a
curious antithesis, which a Martian might contemplate with amused detachment.
But for us it is a matter of life and death. Upon its issue depends the
question whether our grandchildren are to live in a
happier world, or are to exterminate each other by scientific methods, leaving
perhaps to <span class=GramE>negroes</span> and Papuans the future destinies of
mankind.</p>
