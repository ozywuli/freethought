<p><span
class=SpellE>Moncure Conway</span>, in whose <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
we are assembled to-day, devoted his life to two great objects: freedom of
thought and freedom of the individual. In regard to both these objects,
something has been gained since his time, but something also has been lost. New
dangers, somewhat different in form from those of past ages, threaten both
kinds of freedom, and unless a vigorous and vigilant public opinion can be
aroused in <span class=SpellE>defence</span> of them, there will be much less
of both a hundred years hence than there is now. My purpose in this address is
to emphasize the new dangers and to consider how they can be met.</p>

<p>Let us begin by trying to be clear as
to what we mean by “free thought.” This expression has two senses. In its
narrower sense it means thought which does not accept
the dogmas of traditional religion. In this sense a man is a “free thinker” if
he is not a Christian or a Mussulman or a Buddhist or a <span class=SpellE>Shintoist</span>
or a member of any of the other bodies of men who accept some inherited
orthodoxy. In Christian countries a man is called a “free thinker” if he does
not decidedly believe in God, though this would not suffice to make a man a
“free thinker” in a Buddhist country.</p>

<p>I do not wish to minimize the
importance of free thought in this sense. I am myself a dissenter from all
known religions, and I hope that every kind of religious belief will die out. I
do not believe that, on the balance, religious belief has been a force for
good. Although I am prepared to admit that in certain times and places it has
had some good effects, I regard it as belonging to the infancy of human reason,
and to a stage of development which we are now outgrowing.</p>

<p>But there is also a wider sense of
“free thought,” which I regard as of still greater importance. Indeed, the harm
done by traditional religions seems chiefly traceable to the fact that they
have prevented free thought in this wider sense. The
wider sense is not so easy to define as the narrower, and it will be well to
spend some little time in trying to arrive at its essence.</p>

<p>When we speak of anything as “free,”
our meaning is not definite unless we can say what it is free <i>from</i>.
Whatever or whoever is “free” is not subject to some external compulsion, and
to be precise we ought to say what this kind of compulsion is. Thus thought is
“free” when it is free from certain kinds of outward control which are often
present. Some of these kinds of control which must be absent if thought is to
be “free” are obvious, but others are more subtle and elusive.</p>

<p>To begin with the most obvious. Thought
is not “free” when legal penalties are incurred by the holding or not holding
of certain opinions, or by giving expression to one’s belief or lack of belief
on certain matters. Very few countries in the world have as yet even this
elementary kind of freedom. In England, under the Blasphemy Laws, it is illegal
to express disbelief in the Christian religion, though in practice the law is
not set in motion against the well-to-do. It is also
illegal to teach what Christ taught on the subject of non-resistance.
Therefore, whoever wishes to avoid becoming a criminal must profess to agree
with Christ’s teaching, but must avoid saying what that teaching <span
class=GramE>was.</span> In America no one can enter the country without first
solemnly declaring that he disbelieves in anarchism and polygamy; and, once
inside, he must also disbelieve in communism. In Japan it is illegal to express
disbelief in the divinity of the Mikado. It will thus be seen that a voyage
round the world is a perilous adventure. A Mohammedan, a <span class=SpellE>Tolstoyan</span>,
a Bolshevik, or a Christian cannot undertake it without at some point becoming
a criminal, or holding his tongue about what he considers important truths.
This, of course, applies only to steerage passengers; saloon passengers are
allowed to believe whatever they please, provided they avoid offensive
obtrusiveness.</p>

<p>It is clear that the most elementary
condition, if thought is to be free, is the absence of legal penalties for the
expression of opinions. No great country has yet reached
to this level, although most of them think they have. The opinions which are
still persecuted strike the majority as so monstrous and immoral that the
general principle of toleration cannot be held to apply to them. But this is
exactly the same view as that which made possible the tortures of the
Inquisition. There was a time when Protestantism seemed as wicked as Bolshevism
seems now. Please do not infer from this remark that I am either a Protestant
or a Bolshevik.</p>

<p>Legal penalties are, however, in the
modern world, the least of the obstacles to freedom of thoughts. The two great
obstacles are economic penalties and distortion of evidence. It is clear that
thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions makes it impossible
to earn a living. It is clear also that thought is not free if all the
arguments on one side of a controversy are perpetually presented as
attractively as possible, while the arguments on the other side can only be
discovered by diligent search. Both these obstacles exist in every large
country known to me, except China, which is the last refuge of freedom. It is these obstacles with which I shall be concerned—their
present magnitude, the likelihood of their increase, and the possibility of
their diminution.</p>

<p>We may say that thought is free when it
is exposed to free competition among beliefs—i.e., when all beliefs are able to
state their case, and no legal or pecuniary advantages or disadvantages attach
to beliefs. This is an ideal which, for various reasons, can never be fully
attained. But it is possible to approach very much nearer to it than we do at
present.</p>

<p>Three incidents in my own life will
serve to show how, in modern England, the scales are weighted in <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> of Christianity. My reason for mentioning them is
that many people do not at all realize the disadvantages to which avowed
Agnosticism still exposes people.</p>

<p>The first incident belongs to a very
early stage in my life. My father was a Freethinker, but died when I was only
three years old. Wishing me to be brought up without superstition, he appointed
two Freethinkers as my guardians. The Courts, however, set aside his will, and had me educated in the Christian faith. I
am afraid the result was disappointing, but that was not the fault of the law. If
he had directed that I should be educated as a Christadelphian or a <span
class=SpellE>Muggletonian</span> or a <span class=GramE>Seventh-Day</span>
Adventist, the Courts would not have dreamed of objecting. A parent has a right
to ordain that any imaginable superstition shall be instilled into his children
after his death, but has not the right to say that they shall be kept free from
superstition if possible.</p>

<p>The second incident occurred in the
year 1910. I had at that time a desire to stand for Parliament as a Liberal,
and the Whips recommended me to a certain constituency. I addressed the Liberal
Association, who expressed themselves <span class=SpellE>favourably</span>, and
my adoption seemed certain. But, on being questioned by a small inner caucus, I
admitted that I was an Agnostic. They asked whether the fact would come out,
and I said it probably would. They asked whether I should be willing to go to
church occasionally, and I replied that I should not. Consequently, they
selected another candidate, who was duly elected, has
been in Parliament ever since, and is a member of the present Government.</p>

<p>The third incident occurred immediately
afterwards. I was invited by Trinity College, Cambridge, to become a lecturer,
but not a Fellow. The difference is not pecuniary; it is that a Fellow has a
voice in the government of the College, and cannot be dispossessed during the
term of his Fellowship except for grave immorality. The chief reason for not
offering me a Fellowship was that the clerical party did not wish to add to the
anti-clerical vote. The result was that they were able to dismiss me in 1916,
when they disliked my views on the War.<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" 
href="#dismissed" id="dismissed-ref"></a>
If I had been dependent on my lectureship, I should have starved.</p>

<p>These three incidents illustrate
different kinds of disadvantages attaching to avowed freethinking even in
modern England. Any other avowed Freethinker could supply similar incidents
from his personal experience, often of a far more serious character. The net
result is that people who are not well-to-do dare not be frank about their
religious beliefs.</p>

<p>It is not, of course, only or even
chiefly in regard to religion that there is lack of freedom. Belief in
communism or free love handicaps a man much more than Agnosticism. Not only is
it a disadvantage to hold those views, but it is very much more difficult to
obtain publicity for the arguments in their <span class=SpellE>favour</span>.
On the other hand, in Russia the advantages and disadvantages are exactly
reversed: comfort and power are achieved by professing Atheism, communism, and
free love, and no opportunity exists for propaganda against these opinions. The
result is that in Russia one set of fanatics feels absolute certainty about one
set of doubtful propositions, while in the rest of the world another set of fanatics
feels equal certainty about a diametrically opposite set of equally doubtful
propositions. From such a situation war, bitterness, and persecution inevitably
result on both sides.</p>

<p>William James used to preach the “will
to believe.” For my part, I should wish to preach the “will to doubt.” None of
our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and
error. The methods of increasing the degree of truth
in our beliefs are well known; they consist in hearing all sides, trying to
ascertain all the relevant facts, controlling our own bias by discussion with
people who have the opposite bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard any
hypothesis which has proved inadequate. These methods are <span class=SpellE>practised</span>
in science, and have built up the body of scientific knowledge. Every man of
science whose outlook is truly scientific is ready to admit that what passes
for scientific knowledge at the moment is sure to require correction with the
progress of discovery; nevertheless, it is near enough to the truth to serve
for most practical purposes, though not for all. In science, where alone
something approximating to genuine knowledge is to be found, men’s attitude is
tentative and full of doubt.</p>

<p>In religion and politics, on the
contrary, though there is as yet nothing approaching scientific knowledge,
everybody considers it <i>de rigueur</i> to have a dogmatic opinion, to be
backed up by inflicting starvation, prison, and war, and to be carefully
guarded from argumentative competition with any different opinion. If only men
could be brought into a tentatively agnostic frame of
mind about these matters, nine-tenths of the evils of the modern world would be
cured. War would become impossible, because each side would realize that both
sides must be in the wrong. Persecution would cease. Education would aim at
expanding the mind, not at narrowing it. Men would be chosen for jobs on
account of fitness to do the work, not because they flattered the irrational
dogmas of those in power. Thus rational doubt alone, if it could be generated,
would suffice to introduce the millennium.</p>

<p>We have had in recent years a brilliant
example of the scientific temper of mind in the theory of relativity and its
reception by the world. Einstein, a German-Swiss-Jew pacifist, was appointed to
a research professorship by the German Government in the early days of the War;
his predictions were verified by an English expedition which observed the
eclipse of 1919, very soon after the Armistice. His theory upsets the whole
theoretical framework of traditional physics; it is almost as damaging to
orthodox dynamics as Darwin was to <i>Genesis</i>. Yet physicists everywhere have shown complete readiness to accept his
theory as soon as it appeared that the evidence was in its <span class=SpellE>favour</span>.
But none of them, least of all Einstein himself, would claim that he has said
the last word. He has not built a monument of infallible dogma to stand for all
time. There are difficulties he cannot solve; his doctrines will have to be
modified in their turn as they have modified Newton’s. This critical undogmatic
receptiveness is the true attitude of science.</p>

<p>What would have happened if Einstein
had advanced something equally new in the sphere of religion or politics?
English people would have found elements of <span class=SpellE>Prussianism</span>
in his theory; anti-Semites would have regarded it as a Zionist plot;
nationalists in all countries would have found it tainted with lily-livered
pacifism, and proclaimed it a mere dodge for escaping military service. All the
old-fashioned professors would have approached Scotland Yard to get the
importation of his writings prohibited. Teachers <span class=SpellE>favourable</span>
to him would have been dismissed. He, meantime, would have captured the
Government of some backward country, where it would have
become illegal to teach anything except his doctrine, which would have grown
into a mysterious dogma not understood by anybody. Ultimately the truth or
falsehood of his doctrine would be decided on the battlefield, without the
collection of any fresh evidence for or against it. This method is the logical
outcome of William James’s will to believe.</p>

<p>What is wanted is not the will to
believe, but the wish to find out, which is its exact opposite.</p>

<p>If it is admitted that a condition of
rational doubt would be desirable, it becomes important to inquire how it comes
about that there is so much irrational certainty in the world. A great deal of
this is due to the inherent irrationality and credulity of average human
nature. But this seed of intellectual original sin is nourished and fostered by
other agencies, among which three play the chief part—namely, education,
propaganda, and economic pressure. Let us consider these in turn.</p>
