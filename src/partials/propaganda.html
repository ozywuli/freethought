<p>(2) <i>Propaganda.</i>—<span
class=GramE>Our</span> system of education turns young people out of the
schools able to read, but for the most part unable to weigh evidence or to form
an independent opinion. They are then assailed, throughout the rest of their lives, by statements designed to make them
believe all sorts of absurd propositions, such as that Blank’s pills cure all
ills, that Spitzbergen is warm and fertile, and that Germans eat corpses. The
art of propaganda, as <span class=SpellE>practised</span> by modern politicians
and governments, is derived from the art of advertisement. The science of
psychology owes a great deal to advertisers. In former days most psychologists
would probably have thought that a man could not convince many people of the
excellence of his own wares by merely stating emphatically that they were
excellent. Experience shows, however, that they were mistaken in this. If I
were to stand up once in a public place and state that I am the most modest man
alive, I should be laughed at; but if I could raise enough money to make the
same statement on all the busses and on hoardings along all the principal
railway lines, people would presently become convinced that I had an abnormal
shrinking from publicity. If I were to go to a small shopkeeper and say: “Look
at your competitor over the way, he is getting your business; don’t you think
it would be a good plan to leave your business and
stand up in the middle of the road and try to shoot him before he shoots
you?”—if I were to say this, any small shopkeeper would think me mad. But when
the Government says it with emphasis and a brass band, the small shopkeepers
become enthusiastic, and are quite surprised when they find afterwards that
business has suffered. Propaganda, conducted by the means which advertisers
have found successful, is now one of the recognized methods of government in
all advanced countries, and is especially the method by which democratic
opinion is created.</p>

<p>There are two quite different evils
about propaganda as now <span class=SpellE>practised</span>. On the one hand,
its appeal is generally to irrational causes of belief rather than to serious
argument; on the other hand, it gives an unfair advantage to those who can
obtain most publicity, whether through wealth or through power. For my part, I
am inclined to think that too much fuss is sometimes made about the fact that
propaganda appeals to emotion rather than reason. The line between emotion and
reason is not <span class=GramE>so</span> sharp as some people
think. Moreover, a clever man could frame a sufficiently rational argument in <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> of any position which has any chance of being
adopted. There are always good arguments on both sides of any real issue.
Definite <span class=SpellE>mis</span>-statements of fact can be legitimately
objected to, but they are by no means necessary. The mere words “Pear’s Soap,”
which affirm nothing, cause people to buy that article. If, wherever these
words appear, they were replaced by the words “The <span class=SpellE>Labour</span>
Party,” millions of people would be led to vote for the <span class=SpellE>Labour</span>
Party, although the advertisements had claimed no merit for it whatever. But if
both sides in a controversy were confined by law to statements which a
committee of eminent logicians considered relevant and valid, the main evil of
propaganda, as at present conducted, would remain. Suppose, under such a law,
two parties with an equally good case, one of whom had a million pounds to
spend on propaganda, while the other had only a hundred thousand. It is obvious
that the arguments in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of the richer party
would become more widely known than those in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
of the poorer party, and therefore the richer party
would win. This situation is, of course, intensified when one party is the
Government. In Russia the Government has an almost complete monopoly of
propaganda, but that is not necessary. The advantages which it possesses over
its opponents will generally be sufficient to give it the victory, unless it
has an exceptionally bad case.</p>

<p>The objection to propaganda is not only
its appeal to unreason, but still more the unfair advantage which it gives to
the rich and powerful. Equality of opportunity among opinions is essential if
there is to be real freedom of thought; and equality of opportunity among
opinions can only be secured by elaborate laws directed to that end, which
there is no reason to expect to see enacted. The cure is not to be sought
primarily in such laws, but in better education and a more <span class=SpellE>sceptical</span>
public opinion. For the moment, however, I am not concerned to discuss cures.</p>
